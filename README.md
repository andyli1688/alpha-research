#1. Overnight Returns and Firm-Specific Investor Sentiment
   Abstract: stocks with high (low) overnight returns underperform (outperform) over the longer-term, consistent with evidence of temporary sentiment-driven mispricing.

   Abstract: past returns and the formation process of past returns have a joint effect on future expected returns. We argue that how one stock becomes a winner or loser—that is, the movement of historical prices—plays an important role in momentum investing.
